# Project_4_group-2

Executive Summary:

Our group discussed drugs and the dark web via Kaggle.com datasets.  We defined the dark web and provided examples of the extent of some of the recent illegal activities on the dark web.  We created a model to predict the cost of cocaine sales.  We looked at cocaine price versus the drug quality.  We created tableau dashboards showing how cocaine sales compare to other illicit drug sales.  We even have a map showing top countries of dark web drug sales along with top vendors.  
With this being a capstone project, we used many of the things we learned in the bootcamp including data cleaning, machine learning, flask apps, building the front end and back end, tableau visualizations, and building a website. 

There is more information needed for further research.  Obviously, it would be extremely difficult to fully determine the true extent to dark web illegal drug sales.  Also, we would need more information in regards to each country's illegal drug activity via the dark web.
